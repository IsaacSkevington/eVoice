# Evoice
Welcome to the Evoice Survey Software repository  

# Compiling from source
Source code can be compiled using build.bat, with Python and pip on path. The requirements will be automatically installed.  
Currently working on a program to automatically create the database schema.

# Downloading for use
The compiled executable binary is in bin.  
PLEASE NOTE: The server for this program is not currently running, so the executable will not work.
